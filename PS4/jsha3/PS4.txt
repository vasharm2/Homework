HOW TO RUN YOUR CODE:
clang++ main.cpp problem1.cpp problem2.cpp


Try running your code right now. You'll obviously see quite a few errors.

Problem 1:
In main, we are trying to instantiate a problem1 object, and then call one of its functions. However, our compiler
cannot find class type. However, we can see it all right there in problem1.cpp!!!
To correctly create a problem1 object, we want our main to know that the file exists. we can do this by including the
appropriate header file in main.cpp! Create the header file for problem1, and include it in the main.cpp. Be sure to include
the problem1 header file (.h) in the problem1 source file (.cpp).


Problem 2:
Remember to include any header files for classes you'll be using in main! In problem2, there is something wrong with your header
file. Remember that the functions defined in your header file are prototypes for the functions defined in the source (.cpp) file.

Problem 3:
Here, we have an issue with problem3help being included twice. Add include guards where appropriate!
