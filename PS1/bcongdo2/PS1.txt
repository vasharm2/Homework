PROBLEM SET 1
Welcome to CS 196, in addition to your semester project we would also like to
help you guys prepare traditional software engineering jobs. As such these
homeworks will consist of classic interview problems, advanced programming
problems and challenges in debugging and other traditional tasks.


Problem 1 - Anagrams

A common problem in computer science is finding patterns within data.
This problem will simulate that in a way that is easy to see what is happening.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which
reads the same backward or forward. Allowances may be made for adjustments to
capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers.

An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another.

Given a String S, determine if it is an anagram of a palindrome. Return true if
the String is an anagram of a palindrome, and false otherwise. For example, the
String “oatrtro” will return true (rotator), while the String “false” will
return false.

Input format - via txt file:
The first line will contain a integer, the number of test cases
The following lines will be strings to be evaluated

Output format:
Print true or false to console (STDOUT)
Line separated please

Ex.
4
aabb
abba
xyyxy
axsx

true
true
true
false


Code is provided in Java to run STIN from a text file
Feel free to rewrite this in any language


Problem 2 - Diagonal Matrix

Given a square matrix size N x N, calculate the product of the sums across the
two main diagonals. For example, given the matrix:

Input format - via txt file:
Then first line contains an integer X which is the number of test cases

Each test case contains an integer N which is the dimensions of the square matrix
This will be followed by the contents of the matrix being read left to right

Ex.
3

4	5	7
3	1	5
9	3	2

Output Format - console
Print the product of the sums of the diagonals ((4 + 1 + 2) (9 + 1 + 7))
Line separated please
119

Code is provided in Java to run STIN from a text file
Feel free to rewrite this in any language

Problem 3 - Pyramid
Given an integer input N, print a staircase out of height N. For example, given
the input 4, print out the following staircase:

    #
   ##
  ###
 ####
#####

Input format - from text file:
The first line contains an integer with the number of test cases.
The following lines are the heights of the pyramids

Ex.
2
4
4

Output format - console
Print to console line separated pyramids
    #
   ##
  ###
 ####
#####
    #
   ##
  ###
 ####
#####







************************************************
WRITE YOUR OWN TEST CASES!!!!


We deliberately gave an incomplete set of test cases, please add more to thoroughly test your code.


How to add test cases:


Problem 1 -
The first integer in the text file is the number of test case inputs. Every string after that is an input string
Increment the test case counter when adding in additional test cases.

Problem 2 -
The first integer in the text file is the number of test case inputs. After that, each test case consists of the dimension of the matrix,
followed by the actual matrix.

When adding in additional test cases, increment the test case counter at the top, then append the dimension, and then the matrix
itself.

Problem 3 - 
The first integer in the text file is the number of test case inputs. After that are the test cases themselves, namely the heights of the stairs
to print. When adding test cases, increment the test cast input counter, and append heights of stairs test cases to the file.
