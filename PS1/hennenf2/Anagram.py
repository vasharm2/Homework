Problem set 1


Question 1

A common problem in computer science is finding patterns within data.
This problem will simulate that in a way that is easy to see what is happening.

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward or forward.
Allowances may be made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers.

an anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another.


Given a String S, determine if it is an anagram of a palindrome.
Return true if the String is an anagram of a palindrome, and false otherwise.
For example, the String 'oatrtro' will return true (rotator), while the String 'false' will return false.
